The above code demonstrates Eye disease detection using the AlexNet architecture. 5 classes of Eye Diseases included, Bulging Eyes, Cataract,Crossed Eyes ,Glaucoma and Uveitis

As seen above, AlexNet has 5 Convolutional Layers followed by 2 Fully Connected Layers. To minimize overfitting , Dropout and BatchNormalization layers are also used in between the layers.
